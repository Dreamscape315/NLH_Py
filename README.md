# NLH_Py
This is a Python&Cython implementation of NLH.

Refer to [Matlab&C++ ](https://github.com/Dreamscape315/NLH)Version

Now only support single thread and grayscale image. Some key methods need to improve performance and are therefore written in Cython. Maybe a numpy version will be programmed later and all source code will be open.

Python 3.7.0
